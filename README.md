[FlowBite](https://flowbite.design/docs/getting-started/introduction/) is an open-source set of UI components and elements built with the utility-first Tailwind CSS framework. It includes multiple components such as buttons, alerts, modals, dropdowns, cards, navbars and many more.

## Documentation

We recommend you to [read the documentation](https://flowbite.design/docs/getting-started/introduction/) and follow the instructions directly from there as you will be able to find everything from getting started, browsing the components and building for production.

## Quickstart

There are multiple ways that you can include it into your project.

We recommend setting up your project using the [build tools](https://flowbite.design/docs/getting-started/build-tools/) guide to be able to build for production.

## Include via CDN

The quickest way to get started working with FlowBite is to simply include the CSS and JavaScript into your project via CDN.

Require the following stylesheet inside the `head` tag:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@themesberg/flowbite@latest/dist/flowbite.min.css" />
```

And include the following javascript file before the end of the `body` element:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@themesberg/flowbite@latest/dist/flowbite.bundle.js"></script>
```

**Important:** This is *not the recommended way* of working with FlowBite because you won't be able to purge the unnecessary CSS. Check out the [build tools](https://flowbite.design/docs/getting-started/build-tools/) to properly set up FlowBite for development and production code.

## Require via NPM

You can also require FlowBite as a dependency using NPM by running the following command:

```bash
npm i @themesberg/flowbite
```

## Upgrade to pro

There is also a pro version of FlowBite available featuring more components, an application UI layout, marketing UI pages, e-commerce pages and also Figma design files.
