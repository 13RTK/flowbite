[Symfony](https://symfony.com/) is one of the definitive web application frameworks in the PHP ecosystem offering over 50 stadalone PHP components and a MVC framework for your web application that you can use to build complex applications, website pages and even API services.

The Symfony PHP framework was first launched as an open-source software back in 2005 by SensioLabs SAS and it is currently used by numerous companies and frameworks including Laravel, Spotify, BlaBlaCar, Trivago, Dailymotion and more.

Follow the steps from this guide to learn how to create a new Symfony project on your local computer, install and configure the Tailwind CSS framework, and finally install Flowbite and leverage the open-source UI components to build websites even faster.

## Requirements

Make sure that before you get started you have both [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your local environment to make sure that Symfony, Tailwind CSS and Flowbite can be properly set up and configured.

## Create a Symfony project

The most straightforward approach for creating a new Symfony project is to use the official [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download) installer which you can easily install on macOS and Linux devices using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install symfony-cli/tap/symfony-cli
```

For devices running on Windows you can also install the Symfony CLI using Scoop:

```bash
scoop install symfony-cli
```

Now that you have the CLI available you can proceed by creating a new project.

1. Create a new Symfony project by running the following command inside your terminal:

```bash
symfony new --webapp my_application
```

This command will create a new folder with a fresh Symfony project installation inside.
