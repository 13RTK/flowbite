FlowBite is an open-source project and you there are multiple ways that you can include it into your project.

## Using CDN

This is not the recommended way to work with FlowBite because we recommend you to purge the CSS before releasing code for production, but it can be a great way to quickly get started and test the project.

Require the following stylesheet stylesheet inside the `head` tag:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.24.1/themes/prism.min.css" />
```

And include the following javascript file before the end of the `body` element:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.24.1/themes/prism.min.js"></script>
```

## Require via NPM

You can also require FlowBite as a dependency using NPM by running the following command:

```bash
npm install flowbite
```

## Download as a zip

If you want to directly download the source and dist files of the FlowBite project you can do so by [creating an account for free on FlowBite](https://flowbite.design/) and download the project files from there.

## Clone it from Github

The source files are also available to be cloned or downloaded from the official [Github repository](https://github.com). Don't forget to give it a star if you appreciate the project.
