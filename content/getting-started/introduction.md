## What is FlowBite?

FlowBite is an open-source library of UI elements based on the utility-first CSS framework Tailwind designed and coded by [Themesberg](https://themesberg.com) available in Figma and as web components.

It includes all of the commonly used components that a website requires, such as buttons, dropdowns, navigation bars, modals, but also some more advanced interactive elements such as datepickers. 

All of the elements are built using utility classes from Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

Here's a quick overview of the Flowbite ecosystem including the open source Tailwind components library, the Figma design files, and the pro version.

## Why use FlowBite?

One of the disadvantages of Tailwind CSS compared to other frameworks is that it doesn't have a base set of components. This makes it really hard to quickly prototype a user interface. 

**This is where FlowBite comes into play**: it's basically Tailwind CSS, but you get all of the components that you would normally get with a classic CSS framework like Bootstrap or Bulma.

There are at least 15 types of components including buttons, alerts, breadcrumbs, pagination, and navbars. FlowBite also includes some custom JavaScript that enables interactive components, such as dropdowns, modals, tooltips, and many more.

## How to get started?

Getting started with FlowBite is fairly easy: all you need to do is follow the [quickstart guide]({{< ref "getting-started/quickstart" >}}) or set up an advanced workflow by following the [build tools guide]({{< ref "getting-started/build-tools" >}}).

## Figma design files

If you'd like to work with a Figma design file you can either duplicate the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/973638860086718856" target="_blank">free version on Figma Community</a> or upgrade for additional application UI, marketing UI, and e-commerce sections and pages with [FlowBite Pro](https://flowbite.com).

## Upgrade to Pro

If you want to take your Tailwind development workflow to the next level you can check out the [pro version of Flowbite](https://flowbite.com) which includes fully coded pages and layouts for application, marketing, and e-commerce websites.

## Licensing

The components library of FlowBite is open-source under the [MIT License]({{< ref "getting-started/license" >}}).
