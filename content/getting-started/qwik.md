[Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) is a free and open-source front-end framework built by the team behind Builder that allows you to build instant-loading, scalable and interactive web apps by leveraging the precision lazy-loading feature by asynchronously loading component rendering, tasks, listeners, and styles.

The framework was first released on July 18th, 2021 by Adam Bradley and Mi≈°ko Hevery and has a large community of active developers with a popular GitHub repository with over 18k stars and has a showcase of websites such as Builder.io, Reflact.app, Soundy.cloud and more that rely on Qwik for building websites.

By following this guide you will learn how to create a new Qwik project, install and configure Tailwind CSS and proceed by installing Flowbite to start leveraging the open-source UI components to build interactive and instant-loading websites faster.

## Requirements

Before getting started make sure that you have [Node.js v16.8](https://nodejs.org/en) or higher available on your local machine and we also recommend to install the [Qwik VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnreemar.vscode-qwik-snippets) to enable Qwik snippets.

## Create a Qwik project

1. Create a new project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create qwik@latest
```

The custom CLI (command line interface) from Qwik will prompt you with some questions on how you want your project to be configured - follow the steps until you have a fully working directory.

2. Start a local development server by running:

```bash
npm run start
```

You should now be able to access a boilerplate Qwik project on `http://localhost:5173/` from your local browser and start developing with the framework.
