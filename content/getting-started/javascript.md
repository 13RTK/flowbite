[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, basically powering the client side of nearly 98% percent of all websites alongside HTML and CSS. It is a high-level language which uses dynamic typing and supports features such as object orientation, first-class functions and the web based API allows you access to the DOM (Document Object Model).

Flowbite uses JavaScript to power the interactivity of the more complex UI components such as datepickers, dropdowns, and modals while also leveraging the utility classes from Tailwind CSS. 

There are two main ways you can use JavaScript to power the interactive UI components:

- use the data attributes interface and include the Flowbite JavaScript via NPM or CDN
- programatically create instances of the UI components and call methods and attach events to elements

On this page you will learn how to leverage the Flowbite API to work with the interactivity part of the UI library and how you can customize the default behaviour of the UI components using JavaScript.
