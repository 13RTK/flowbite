[SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) is a popular and open-source declarative JavaScript library that empowers reactive UI interfaces for the web that ensures a performant benchmark, leverages the flexibility of JSX and also provides support for TypeScript, Astro, and Vite.

The SolidJS library is used by many web developers and smaller companies and it was even spotted being used in OpenAI's ChatGPT interface used for artificial intelligence UI/UX interactivity.

By following the steps from this guide you will learn how to create a new project using SolidJS, install and set up Tailwind CSS to leverage the utility classes and finally install and integrate the free and open-source UI components from Flowbite.

## Requirements

Before getting started make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your local machine to be able to install both SolidJS, Tailwind CSS and Flowbite.

## Create a new project

1. Execute the following command in your terminal to create a new SolidJS project using Vite Templates:

```bash
npx degit solidjs/templates/js my-application
cd my-application
```

This command will create a boilerplate project that sets up a basic project structure and dependency files.

2. Install the project dependencies using NPM:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Execute the following command to create a local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The newly created SolidJS project will now be accessible via the browser on `http://localhost:3000`.

4. Create a production build by running the following command in your terminal or deployment pipeline:

```bash
npm run build
```

You now have a working SolidJS project configuration installed and can now proceed with installing Tailwind CSS and Flowbite to build web UI interfaces even faster.
