The chat bubble component is the building block for creating chat interfaces where users can send messages to each other by text, voice notes, images, galleries and other attachments. These components are usually used in chat applications and social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter/X, WhatsApp, and more.

The examples below provide multiple variations of default, outline, and clean styles coded with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS. Some of the components may require you to include the Flowbite JavaScript to enable the dropdowns and tooltips functionality.

## Default copy to clipboard

Use this example to show a simple chat bubble with a text message, user profile and a timestamp.
